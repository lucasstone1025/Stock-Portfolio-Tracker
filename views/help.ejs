    <p>Using the "Search Stock" page you are able to input any stock ticker and 
        add to your watchlist.
    </p>
    <p>Alerts can also be made through the watchlist table on the very right. 
        Choose higher or lower, and when triggered you will receive a message in 
        your email inbox stating the alert triggered at said price.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to data usage etc... the alerts will have to be refreshed in the 
        alerts or watchlist page to check if your email alert has been triggered, 
        and you can see the status of these alerts in the alerts page.
